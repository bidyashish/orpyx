Orpyx Coding Exercise | Bidyashish kumar


Question: Orpyx Coding Exercise:
 
Using node.js (v20), write a program that finds the smallest positive integer that when represented in base 10, moving the least significant digit to become the most significant digit, the new integer is exactly triple the original integer. For example, 14 becomes 41 which is close to triple but not exact. Another close example is 103 becoming 310, again very close to triple but not exact. 

The program must complete in less than 5 seconds on a modern laptop, printing the integer to the console. Please submit one node.js source file. We should be able to execute your code as follows: 



Steps to run code

```
1. git clone git@github.com:bidyashish/orpyx.git

2. node orpyx.js

3. change INPUT_NUM to simulate different number

```
